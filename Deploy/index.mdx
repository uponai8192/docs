## Custom Telephony

Connecting your provider via **SIP Trunk**, **SIP URI**, or an **Extension**.

### Transport Methods Supported
- UDP
- TCP
- TLS
- TLS/SRTP

The easiest method is to connect via **SIP URI**.

---

### What is a SIP URI?
A SIP URI is like a phone number for internet calling. It looks something like:

user@domain.com


It lets your platform make and receive calls over the internet instead of regular phone lines.

---

### What you need:
- A SIP URI
- Login details (username and password)
- Domain and Outbound Proxy
- Your platform's phone system settings

---

### How to connect it:
1. Navigate to **Carriers** under **VoIP Administration**.
2. Click **Add Carrier**.
3. Enter your information.

---

### Predefined Carriers
We have predefined carriers with gateways already set up for:
- Viirtue
- Skyswitch
- Twilio
- Cordial
- NUSO
- Porta One
- RITEL
- Ring Logix
- United Cloud

---

For all connections, you’ll enter the following information:

/>

#### Example of USER information:

- **Register SIP Realm**: Should be your outbound proxy if you have one; otherwise, the domain.

If you did **not** use a predefined carrier:
- Enter the IP addresses under **Gateways**.
- Set the **netmask** and **port**.
- Make sure all IPs are set to **Inbound** and **Active**.
- If you have an outbound proxy, add it as a gateway and set it to **Outbound** and **Active**.

/>

Once info is filled out, click **Add Carrier**.  
You’ll see your new carrier pop up with its status and registration.  
If registration says **failed**, double-check your input and try again.  
Still not working? Contact us and we’ll help you get it connected.
