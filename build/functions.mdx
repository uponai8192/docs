## Overview

After implementing basic conversations, your agent can be enhanced with additional capabilities to perform actions such as:

- Transferring calls
- Booking appointments
- Retrieving external information
- Managing call flow (e.g., ending calls)
- Integrating with your existing systems via API calls

These capabilities can be implemented using **function calling**.

---

## Adding Functions to the Prompt

For all functions, youâ€™ll need to ensure they are triggered in the **prompt** once added to the agent.

**Examples:**
- `If user does not have any more questions, call function end_call to hang up`
- `If the user asks to transfer the call to a specific department or extension, use function transfer_call`

---

## Extension and Transferring

For **internal transfers**, you will need to:

1. Create an **extension directory** within your prompt.
2. Navigate to **Extensions** under the **Agents** tab to manage extensions.

When implementing your directory into the prompt, it might look like this:


<img
  src="/images/fourth.png"
  alt="Begin message type options"
  height="300"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

## Uploading Extensions

Under the **Extensions** tab, you can upload a list of extensions using a `.csv` file.  
A sample file is provided on the page for reference.

Alternatively, you can add extensions manually by entering the information individually.

## Transferring Calls

In your prompt, make sure to trigger this function via `transfer_call`.

### **How to Transfer**
- Invoke `transfer_call`:
  - `action`: `"transfer"`
  - `transfer_to`: Extension from directory
- **Do NOT require/await any caller response after the transfer phrase.**

### **When to Transfer**
- Caller requests any person/department in the extension directory (e.g., *"I want to speak to [name]"* or similar)
- For upgrade, billing, technical issues, or complex/unclear requests

### **What to Say**
- For directory names:  
  *"Sure, let me transfer you now."*
- Otherwise, choose only from:
  - *"Transferring you to [department/person] now."*
  - *"Connecting you with [department/person]."*
  - *"I'll connect you with [department/person] right away."*
