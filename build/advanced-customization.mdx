## Introduction

Configuring the settings of your AI agent is what makes it stand out and gives it what it needs to execute prompts effectively.

## Begin Message Type

- This setting chooses how your agent initiates the conversation:

/>

- **AI Initiates** – The AI starts the conversation with either a fixed message or a prompt-generated welcome message.
- **User Initiates** – The agent waits for the user to speak first.

## Dynamic Variables

- Dynamic variables are special codes that allow you to add specific information to different parts of your agent for each call. They make responses more personal while keeping the main conversation consistent.

**Examples of where you can use them:**

- Prompt
- Begin message
- Transfer call function

**Adding Dynamic Variables:**

- Dynamic variables usually look like this:
  - Hello `{{user_name}}`, I understand you're interested in `{{product_name}}`. How can I help you today?"


- Great for outbound calling:
  - If the customer is already in your system and you use `{{customer_name}}`, your agent will remember and use their name.
  - Try implementing them in your prompt.
