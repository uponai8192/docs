## Overview

After implementing basic conversations, your agent can be enhanced with additional capabilities to perform actions such as:

- Transferring calls
- Booking appointments
- Retrieving external information
- Managing call flow (e.g., ending calls)
- Integrating with your existing systems via API calls

These capabilities can be implemented using **function calling**.

## Adding Functions to the Prompt

For all functions, youâ€™ll need to ensure they are triggered in the **prompt** once added to the agent.

**Examples:**
- `If user does not have any more questions, call function end_call to hang up`
- `If the user asks to transfer the call to a specific department or extension, use function transfer_call`

## Extension and Transferring

For **internal transfers**, you will need to:

1. Create an **extension directory** within your prompt.
2. Navigate to **Extensions** under the **Agents** tab to manage extensions.

When implementing your directory into the prompt, it might look like this:


<img
  src="/images/fourth.png"
  alt="Begin message type options"
  height="300"
  className="rounded-lg"
/>
